how to pick lat and lng from csv, make user pick 2 cols(lat lng)

lat long when in same col can be in any order

start classifying dataâ€¦. enums or range and so on

refining csv after initial has no effect, remove layer ?

handle error when user picks a col that doesn't have geo location info

show refine csv only once we have csv
